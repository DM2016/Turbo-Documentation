The general technology supporting the TURBO graph is a [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) [triplestore](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/rdf+store).  TURBO is currently using [GraphDB](https://ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) 8.6 SE.  Other triplestores with at least some support for [RDFS and OWL](https://www.infowebml.ws/rdf-owl/) reasoning could potentially be substituted with slight modifications.
